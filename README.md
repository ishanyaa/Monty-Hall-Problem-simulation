# Monty-Hall-Problem-stimulation

Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem Stimulation! üö™üêê

Have you ever found yourself pondering the mysteries of game show strategy late at night? Well, you're in for a treat because we're about to dive into the intriguing world of the Monty Hall problem using Python.

What's the Monty Hall Problem?
Imagine you're on a game show, facing three doors. Behind one door is a fabulous prize, and behind the other two, there are... goats. üêê Yes, you read that right, goats!

You choose a door, and then, the host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat. Now, you have a choice: stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door. What's the best strategy?

How This Stimulation Works
In this Python script, we're going to stimulate the Monty Hall problem for a specified number of times. We'll compare the results of two strategies: sticking with the original choice or switching to the other door after a goat is revealed.

The stimulation will provide us with the number of wins for both strategies and the win percentages. Will the stimulation confirm the counterintuitive notion that switching doors is the better strategy? Let's find out!
